Encapsulation:
Vi tillader ikke at andre klasser at bruge variabler i andre klasser gennem metoder alene.


-Private/Public
-Getters and Setters:
    Getter Method :
        While getting the value of a varible we can check in the method that it is initialised or not.
    Setter method :
        While setting the value we can check and so something on the value before setting into variables.
